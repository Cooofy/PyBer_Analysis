# PyBer Analysis

### Overview of Project

Looking at weekly ride share data from rural, subural and urban cities to see if there are ways to improve or to discover new issues.

### Results

As you can see from the chart below, we can clearly see that there are more riders and drivers in Urban cities which would make sense as there is a huge population density compared to the other two city types. Also, with looking at the rural cities it would completely make sense for the average fare earned per driver to be much higher as the destination would be further. As for the suburban areas most of the population density would own a car and would not need to use a rideshare service.

### Summary

If Pyber is looking to increase revenue from rural cities they may need to come up with an incentive plan for both rider and driver so people are most inclined to use this service instead of driving their own car or using another way of transportation. One of the insensitive would be perhaps if you are travelling a certain distance you would get a discount and the driver would earn. Assuming that all drivers pay structure are all the same for each city type there may need to relook at that plan as well. Based on the data shown in the results section we can see most of the revenue is coming from urban cities, however there are many ways of travelling in those cities such as public transportation, walking, taxis, or even riding a bike. To keep up or increase revenue there should be a reward for choosing Pyber as there way of transportation no matter how far the distance is such as every 7th ride is free up to a certain distance. As we look at the chart below, we can see that there is a surge of riders and fares for the week of Feb 24, 2019, there seems to be a reason why everyone decided to use Pyber as a way of transportation. If there was an event or perhaps a week promotion, they should run it multiple times a year for different season to see if the same results happen.
